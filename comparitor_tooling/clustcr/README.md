clusTCR
--------

run setup\_tool.sh to setup the clusTCR conda environment, and clone a copy of the clusTCR repo.

example\_clustcr\_run.ipynb shows clustering and scoring on labeled dataset.

Since clusTCR requires its own env, we perform timing profiling in scripts/timing.py. Results are saved in tcrvalid/results_data.

Timing of other tools is performed in tcrvalid/comparitor_tooling/timing.
